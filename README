This is a simple tutorial that demonstrates how images (blobs) can be synchronized using Rhosync.

There are three applications:

1) pics: the Rhodes application that runs on the Android simulator;
2) pics-server: the Rhosync application; and
3) pstore: a RoR applications that it the backing datastore for pics-server.
